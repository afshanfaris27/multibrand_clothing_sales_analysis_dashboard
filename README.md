This project presents an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard developed in Power BI, consisting of four analytical pages: Sales, Product, Brand, and Customer Analysis.

The solution was built using a Kaggle dataset. The data underwent cleaning, transformation, and structured modeling using Power Query and relational data modeling techniques before visualization. The objective of the dashboard is to evaluate overall sales performance, product-level profitability, brand contribution, and customer behavioral patterns.
